// I. Variable & Datatypes
    // A. Q + A
        // 1. We assign a value by using const or let 
        // and the assignment operator (=)

        // 2. If we assigned a value using let we can change 
        // the variable by "assigning" it a new value. 
        // However if we used const then we must "mutate" 
        // the variable.

        // 3. let name = "Jerry";
        // (to change the value of name)
        // name = "Sharon";

        // 4. declare, assign, and define are all referring 
        // to the process of writing some code (assigning 
        // value to a variable or declaring a function) so 
        // it can be invoked or called upon throughout the code.

        // 5. pseudocoding is where you write out the code 
        // you want to put together in plain english first.
        // It is an important step as it helps to 
        // organize and set up your code. 

        // 6. I think 50% of thinking about how you're going
        // to solve a problem is sufficient. It's important
        // to make your goals clear, and I believe in a good
        // plan. Planning allows you to be open-minded and
        // organized. The other 50% of the time should be 
        // spent on executing your plan or the multiple ideas
        // you thought of.
